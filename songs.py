    Yeah, I know sometimes
    Things may not always make sense to you right now
    But hey, what'd daddy always tell you?
    Straighten up, little soldier
    Stiffen up that upper lip
    What you cryin' about?
    You got me
    Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
    When I'm gone, but I'm tryna give you the life that I never had
    I can see you're sad even when you smile, even when you laugh
    I can see it in your eyes, deep inside, you wanna cry
    'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
    No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
    We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
    Lainie, uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
    We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
    When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
    Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you
    Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
    I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow, it seems
    The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
    All the things growin' up as daddy that he had to see
    Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
    We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
    But things have got so bad between us
    I don't see us ever being together ever again
    Like we used to be when we was teenagers
    But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
    I guess it was never meant to be
    But it's just something we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
    But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
    Maybe one day, we'll wake up, and this will all just be a dream
    Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
    Everything's gonna be alright
    Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
    Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
    I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
    We feel how we feel inside
    It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
    But I promise mama's gon' be alright
    Huh, it's funny
    I remember back one year when daddy had no money
    Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
    And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
    I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
    'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see, daddy had a job
    But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
    And at the time, every house that we lived in
    Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed
    Or shot up on the block
    And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
    Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
    Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
    And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
    And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
    Mom and dad was arguin' a lot
    So mama moved back on to Chalmers in a flat one-bedroom apartment
    And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
    And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
    And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and mama out to see me
    But daddy had to work, you and mama had to leave me
    Then you started seeing daddy on the TV, and mama didn't like it
    And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
    Papa was a rolling stone, mama developed a habit
    And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
    I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first-hand
    'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
    Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
    Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
    To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
    Wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here
    Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
    I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
    Shh, mama's only gone for the moment
    Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
    Everything's gonna be alright
    Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
    Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
    I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
    We feel how we feel inside
    It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
    But I promise mama's gon' be alright
    And if you ask me to, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
    I'ma give you the world
    I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
    I'll do anything for you to see you smile
    And if that mockingbird don't sing, and that ring don't shine
    I'ma break that birdie's neck
    I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
    And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad """,
    "blindinglights": """ Yeah
    I've been tryna call
    I've been on my own for long enough
    Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
    I'm going through withdrawals
    You don't even have to do too much
    You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
    I look around and
    Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
    No one's around to judge me (oh)
    I can't see clearly when you're gone
    I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
    No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
    I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
    Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
    (Hey, hey, hey)
    I'm running out of time
    'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
    So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
    The city's cold and empty (oh)
    No one's around to judge me (oh)
    I can't see clearly when you're gone
    I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
    No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
    I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
    Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
    I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
    I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
    Will never let you go this time (ooh)
    I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
    No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
    (Hey, hey, hey)
    I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
    No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch """,
    "save your tears": """ Ooh
    Na-na, yeah
    I saw you dancing in a crowded room
    You look so happy when I'm not with you
    But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
    A single teardrop falling from your eye
    I don't know why I run away
    I'll make you cry when I run away
    You could've asked me why I broke your heart
    You could've told me that you fell apart
    But you walked past me like I wasn't there
    And just pretended like you didn't care
    I don't know why I run away
    I'll make you cry when I run away
    Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
    Save your tears for another
    Save your tears for another day
    Save your tears for another day
    So, I made you think that I would always stay
    I said some things that I should never say
    Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
    And now you won't love me for a second time
    I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
    Said I'll make you cry when I run away
    Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
    Save your tears for another
    I realize that I'm much too late
    And you deserve someone better
    Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah)
    Save your tears for another day (yeah)
    I don't know why I run away
    I'll make you cry when I run away
    Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (ah)
    I said save your tears for another day (ah)
    Save your tears for another day (ah)
    Save your tears for another day (ah) """,
